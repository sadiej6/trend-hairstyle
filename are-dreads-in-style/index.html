It is easy to style up with dreadlocks. Its only recently that google has now categorized the image search for dreadlock styles into 1 white women 2 braid 3 wale 4 weddings 5 white men 6 mohawk sure the majority of images are of black people with styled hair but thats the actual listing above. When you style it in this fashion, the hair is strategically placed to withstand the wear and tear of daily life. And just as one can transform an undifferentiated mass of hair strands into an impressive coiffure with the right vision and a little skill, so too can a capable stylist take a headful of dreads, apply a few artistic touches, and turn it into something inspired.
