You Should Be Sleeping With Your Hair In A Bun Every Night From pinterest.com
Keeping hair covered and off of your face at night will help prevent the oils from your hair getting into the pores on your face and potentially clogging them. For curlier, kinky textures, don’t brush your hair but softly tuck it in your bonnet. Your hair may also get wrapped or entangled in your pajamas, if it is past your shoulders or in your arms and hands as you sleep. Moisturize your hair with an overnight solution to treat dry and broken ends.
