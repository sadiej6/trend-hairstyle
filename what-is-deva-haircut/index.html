Deva Cut Kinky Curly Hair HairStyle Arti 241 Photos From hollymadisonpicsfpa.blogspot.com

The devacut was created by the devachan salon and is a special technique for cutting curly, wavy or coily hair. It is a dry cutting technique that is used on dry curly hair, never texturizing or thinning the hair because slicing into the interior of a curly haircut has the potential to create frizz.
