The 10 Most Flattering Haircuts for Oval Faces Allure From allure.com
A severely cut bob doesn’t work well for rounded cheeks or long face shapes. A short haircut with some kind of pompadour or quiff is another great option for men with oval faces. When choosing a hairstyle, you need to pay attention to reducing the width of your face on both sides and increasing the length of your face to make your face more oval. So the best haircut for long faces or the best haircut for an oblong face would be a full, medium length hairstyle.
