7 Protective Hairstyles for Sleeping Curling Diva From curlingdiva.com
As you incorporate more protective “night” hairstyles into your regimen, we also recommend wearing a silk scarf, satin bonnet, silk pillowcase, or alternative headwrap to cover (and “protect”) your hair overnight. Compared to long braids, soft updos will ensure that you won’t get hair in your face or that you won’t get too hot during the summer. For looser curls, simply use fewer sections with more hair. Jump in the pool without a care.
