Keeping the hair at the back and on the sides fairly long, is convenient as it means it works with plenty of different hair types, including straight, curly, thick and fine hair. The remaining hair, the mohawk section, is long and usually straight. Rather than being pushed back or to the front they are pushed sideways and some to the back. You can use a curling iron to add waves and curls to the front of your hair, while keeping the back sleek and straight.
