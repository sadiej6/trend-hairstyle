Short Haircuts for Round Faces and Thin Hair 40&#43; From shorthaircutsmodels.com
A shorter woman can be swallowed up by too much hair, especially if she has long thick curly hair. If the measurement is more than 5.5 centimetres, a long haircut is more advantageous for you. Hairstyles that provide fullness at the top and bottom elongate and flatter the woman with a round face. If the distance between the earlobe and the tip of the chin is less than 5.5 centimetres, you can go to the hairdresser immediately and have your hair cut short with no reservations.
