Part your hair in two sections and create victory rolls. This will work with both short and longer lengths—just comb the hair to the side, flip bangs upward with a comb, and style with a bit of hairspray for hold. Most famously seen on marlon brando in julius caesar (1953), the caesar cut is a short hairstyle with very short, level bangs across the forehead. The hair along the sides are faded out and the hair on the top is nicely combed (a lot of gel added on it).
