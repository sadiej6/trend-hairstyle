31&#43; Hairstyles for Older Women 2019 You Will Amaze Sensod From sensod.org
Droopy eyes and sagging skin are definite signs of aging, and bottom. Regularly exposing your hair to high heat via dryers, flatirons or curling irons isn�t healthy for your hair at any age, because it creates air bubbles within the hair shaft that make individual hairs more prone to breakage, and the longer you do it, the worse it is. Older women and men with long hair that doesn’t suit them have the added burden of looking like they are sadly trying to recapture their youth. Amiel says repetitive styling methods definitely weaken hair.
