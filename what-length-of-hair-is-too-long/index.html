In general, hair length for waxing on any area of the body should be about ¬º‚Äù before it‚Äôs waxed. Strengthen your hair with products containing keratin. But if itÔøΩs long, itÔøΩs paramount that itÔøΩs well taken care off and not too thin, else it goes into crazy, gross territory. Fortunately hair that is too long is reasonably easy to resolve.

<p>Pin by My Hairstyles on long hair Super long hair, Long Argan oil is a great bet for long hair, as it encourages hair growth and helps prevent split ends.
