Pin on CHASE�S FIRST HAIR CUT From pinterest.com
The best time to cut your baby’s hair is after her/his first birthday and/or after 12 months according to my parents. If you cut a baby�s hair before their first birthday, it will give them bad hair. If you insist, or you would like assistance with braiding your baby�s hair, seek out a salon that specializes not only in black hair, but in children�s hair as well. Instead of growing in in a downward direction as hair does, the part of their head i shaved grew in literally in a westward or horizontal direction.
