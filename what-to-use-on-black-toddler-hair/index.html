Did you know that mohawks can actually be formal? Most infants/toddlers won’t have enough hair for a full braid or two french braids, but you won’t need much hair for this cute front braid. Stay away from mineral oil, which will dry out the hair even more. Use natural oils like coconut and massage them in a soft circular motion on the scalp to nourish and moisturize your baby’s hair.
