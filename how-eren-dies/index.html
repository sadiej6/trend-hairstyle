He is still alive inside his new titan body at the very least his head is, but taking into account what happen to him in chapter 119 my guess is he is already mortally injured and will die. Mikasa brings eren�s head to armin and they mourn their friend together. Mangakas don’t all feel comfortable with killing the main character of their stories. What episode does mikasa kill eren in?
