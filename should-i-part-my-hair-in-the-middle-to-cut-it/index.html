How should I cut my “hair”. I’m obviously severely diffuse From reddit.com
Thick, straight hair worn with a center part creates a gorgeous curtain that frames the face. If the hair is cut in a blunt style, you may want to consider a layered style. A middle part hairstyle will give a round face the illusion of length and symmetry. Those with a long or oblong face could try a layered lob haircut for a modern look.
