The pineapple method is a way of styling your hair before you go to bed to ensure your curls don’t get fussed while you sleep and to encourage maximum volume come morning. All you have to do is pull your curls up to the top of your head, then put them in a loose ponytail. It also keeps your strands free of breakage and split ends that form as your head moves around the pillow while you sleep. Pull a length of toilet paper several feet long and wrap it around your head gently enough not to flatten the curls but firmly enough to hold them.
