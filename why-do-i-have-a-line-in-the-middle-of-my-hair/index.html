<p>Any way to make this middle part look Professional or Neat This doesn�t happen if you pull your hair straight back or put it in a ponytail, but most people see their part line unless they purposely style their hair in a different way. Waxing will keep the hair away for longer, but be warned: If it goes away, it�s the cable/connector. If the issue persists, please contact our phone support.</p>
