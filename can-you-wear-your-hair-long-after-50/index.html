How To Wear Long Hair After 40, 50 From fabulousafter40.com
When hair is long, it can become heavy and flat, and with age, you lose body. You still have to take care of gray hair with the proper maintenance, including regular cuts, nourishing conditioners and the occasional hair mask. Many older women wear their long hair beautifully braided, and do not want to do what is considered trendy and stylish. You shouldn’t have to dress a certain way after 40, 50 or more, and i don’t think you have to have gray hair just because you are a certain age.
