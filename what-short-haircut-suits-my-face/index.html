A hairstyle that suits your face shape is one that creates the appearance of symmetry. This includes your face shape, the clothes you wear, and how much time you can afford on styling your hair in the morning. You may not want to go as short as the pixie, but you may be able to wear a shorter bob. Simply upload a photo of you with your hair tied back and your face open, looking directly at the camera.
