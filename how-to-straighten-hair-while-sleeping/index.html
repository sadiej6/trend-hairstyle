Sleep Styler World�s First Heatless Straightener &amp; Curler From kickstarter.com
Since you’re putting weight on different areas of your scalp while you sleep, a wet mane is going to dry at all kinds of funky angles. Bend over at the waist, gathering your curls in a loose ponytail on top of your head. Pinning your hair with hair slides or grips will keep very long hair out of your face as you sleep and will keep it in your chosen style overnight. To keep your hair straight while you sleep, sleep with a silk or satin pillowcase, since these materials will reduce friction between your hair and pillow, thereby preventing frizzy ends.
