Hairstyles for women over 60 are usually on the shorter side and a good short style is a chopped pixie cut. Its main advantage is that it works perfectly with both thick and thin hair. I advise not to settle with just a classic pixie haircut; It’s a great short haircut that looks stylish and youthful.
