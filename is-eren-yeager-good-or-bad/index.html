Attack On Titan 5 Ways Eren Yeager Is Now The Villain From gamerant.com
The change in eren has been too drastic and occurred over too short a time period for me to think that he�ll be the series�s villain at the end; No, according to me, eren is not an evil character or a villain. If eren does end up continuing to play a more villainous role, i think that it�ll end with him sacrificing himself for his loved ones and/or the greater good. Now eren finds himself crushing on a criminal.
