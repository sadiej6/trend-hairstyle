Why does gray hair come back so fast after coloring my hair? From hairfinder.com
When you have too many short layers in front, you end up creating a v shape that is not flattering on anyone. Why is my hair not growing back? If you want to keep your hair long, be careful about too many layers. It’s totally normal for hair to fall out, but a blockage on your scalp will stop new hair from growing back in, leaving you with thinning patches of hair.
