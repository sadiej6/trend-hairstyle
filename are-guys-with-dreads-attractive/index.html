Eline Fleury Beautiful dreadlocks, Dreadlock hairstyles From pinterest.co.uk
My friend has dreads to the middle of his back and i love them especially when twist them and leave the twist in for a few days. Dang i don�t have a type and i don�t have a hair preference but dreads look good on a lot of guys and curly and wavy hair that is definitely a plus but not as long as the guy on the right though. But, if they�re clearly well taken care of and don�t just look like a rat�s nest, they�re hot! Afro hair is more waterproof and better suited for dreaded or braided hairstyles.

<p>bobbyrogers “Portrait of Lerado captured in Minneapolis Tapered hair on the sides and back can be worn by guys to match the style. Dreads have always been one of the sexiest hairstyles, in my opinion, for both women and men. Dreads are a really cool commitment and statement to make with your body.
