Goddess Braids With Weave Step By Step Tutorial Part 2 From youtube.com
If your hair is super soft with a ton of slip, the lack of texture makes it easy for it to return to its old part. For many of us, the middle crown of our hair is often the driest, kinkiest and most brittle. What’s also weird is that the hairs only seem to fall out from the middle of my hairline (at the widow’s peak), and not at the temples, which is where baldness or thinning should be occurring (at least in my family history). In more stubborn cases, you might consider having a body wave performed on the hair to add just a touch of wave to the hair to help mask the parting in back.
