How to Protect Your Hair While Sleeping StyleCaster From stylecaster.com
Another great and less damaging method of keeping your hair off your face is to wrap it in a satin or silk scarf. The number one thing you need to do to preserve your curls overnight is to avoid too much manipulation while you are putting your hair up before you sleep. If you�re a night showerer, make sure to dry your hair completely to prevent tugging and breakage while you sleep. The longer your hair is, the less of this oil will reach the ends of your hair.
