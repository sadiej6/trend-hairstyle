Autumn and winter 2020 is approaching and old women are beginning to try long hair styles and new colors for her hair. I love long hair but my hair is super thin due to losing it from lyme disease, so i go as long as i’d like without it being so unflattering. If you blowdry, use a round brush to create soft curls at the ends of the hair; That’s an old school way of thinking, and it can be disputed in modern times.
