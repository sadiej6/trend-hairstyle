111 best Hair Growth to long from shave or bald or buzz From pinterest.com
It’s not an excuse to wear a hat for 18 months and expect a neatly layered, nourished, jason momoa or jared leto moment on the other side.

So after a month and few days or a week i guess, i�ve got my sides at the point where i really want to have them cut or trimmed. The haircut is pretty flexible, allowing you to cut a long crew cut or a short one.
