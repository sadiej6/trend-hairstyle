HAIR STYLE FASHION From newfashionhairstylesz.blogspot.com
One of mullet haircuts is cheeky and a little odd from the point of view of modern fashionistas. I think one of the big reasons the mullet is back in fashion (aside from the fascination with joe exotic) is that we�re still really obsessed with the 80s. No matter the origins of the revival, it�s clear that mullets are indeed back in style. The modern mullet isn’t quite like the mullet you might remember.
