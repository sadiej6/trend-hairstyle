50 Hairstyles for Round Faces from Classic to Modern From hadviser.com
I mentioned the bob hairstyle before but i want to reiterate just how great various short hairstyles can look on women with round faces. This layered hair on the side of the face also helps to decrease the overall roundness of your face shape. Short hairdos for chubby face are not an unquestioned best choice for women. Do not keep chin length hair, either grow them to shoulder length or chop them short, chin length hair, will only add more width to your already round chubby face, making you look more chubby and bulgy.
