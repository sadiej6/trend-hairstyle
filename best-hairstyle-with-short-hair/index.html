20 Best Ideas Short Layered Hairstyles for Thick Hair From inflexa.com
Flat top haircuts feature short hair on the back and sides with volume on top, cut and styled so that it’s leveled flat and angular. Don’t even get us started on that double pearl crown. You will find a ton of different colored, natural, simple, or highlighted looks in. If you have super thick hair, try internal or “invisible layers” which are added underneath the hair to remove weight for a lighter look.
