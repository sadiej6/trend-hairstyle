On their way home, they meet hannes. She is seen waking eren up, telling him that they need to return to home. She does have a baby, but since the identity of her husband was never revealed, we don’t actually know if it’s jean, which means that we don’t know whether the baby is jean’s. Eren ended up saving both of them because she was useless in that scene.

<p>So you’re telling me that in episode 45, Eren ends&hellip; Oh Finally, with eren and historia‘s marriage, attack on titan reached a happy ending with all characters paired up and living happily ever after.

Mikasa appears for the first time.</p>

<p>When Eren asks what am I to you to Mikasa in season 4, do No, jim didn�t cheat on pam. There are certainly fans who have suggested armin and mikasa could wind up together, though they�re far fewer than the fans who believe either of them could have a relationship with eren instead. The ending sequence is literally the renewal of the vows of eternal love between eren and mikasa. He is a member.</p>
