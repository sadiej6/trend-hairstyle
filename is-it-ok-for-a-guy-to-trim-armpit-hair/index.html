So, it will get really uncomfortable in a couple of months to handle your coarse hair in the armpit area. For most of the guys, there is no special need to shave arms.

Forego the hairstylist�s shears, as they�ll be far too unwieldy to use on yourself, and opt for smaller cuticle scissors instead, which will be easier to maneuver.
