<p>Why do people�s hair turn white with age? Quora In conifers the root hairs of short roots arise from a surface layer of cells, whereas those of long roots arise from the second or third layer of cortical cells. The root hairs increase the surface area of absorption. But even a taproot is more complex than just a single structure. Emergence of root hairs often follows inhibition of elongation.</p>
