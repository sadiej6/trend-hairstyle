If the underside of your hair is curlier than the top layer of your hair (called the canopy) the canopy layer probably has environmental damage. In your case, you should ask yourself if there is any correlation between your daily routine and having the hair display two different wave patterns.</p>

<p>Curly haircuts and why I don’t get my curly hair cut dry Based on the description you provided about your hair, you have 3 different curl patterns. There are several reasons for your hair to be straight at the top and curly at the bottom, the first reason is you may have mixed hair type, naturally you may have the combination of straigh and curly hair textures, these textures are due to.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me why half my hair is curly and the other The most disturbing feature, however, is the ringlets and curls underneath the somewhat straight layer hair on top. My hair also seems to change a lot, going from straight to wavy to downright curly but there never seems to be rhyme or reason to it. It was partially dry, partially wet cut. My hair has always been fine and on.</p>

<p>Side Swept Curls Hairstyles You can experience temporary curls due to humidity, hormonal changes, and even certain medications. Why is the top layer of my hair straight?
