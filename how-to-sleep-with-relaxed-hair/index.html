<p>Sleep press on natural unrelaxed hair. Weightless. Long No matter how much of sound sleeper you are, your hair is bound to get messed up while you snooze. Make sure you are not sleeping on that shoulder. A few key takeaways from the video are: The ends of your hair tend to be drier that your roots, so a little extra moisture before bed can keep. This helps.</p>
<h3 id="when-wrapping-your-hair-wrap-in-the-opposite-direction-to-your-normal-part-hairstylist-vernon-francois-says-sleep-press-on-natural-unrelaxed-hair-weightless-long">When wrapping your hair, wrap in the opposite direction to your normal part, hairstylist vernon francois says. Sleep press on natural unrelaxed hair. Weightless. Long.</h3><p>If you are just starting out my first tip to you would be to throw out your hair grease now so you don’t get tempted to use it again. Ionato suggests goody�s ouchless hair ties (five for $3.99), athletique premium comfort stretch headband (three for $18) or even a scrunchie to avoid a dent. Apply a plastic cap, apply a turbie twist (or hair wrap to secure in place) and go to bed. To keep your hair straight while you sleep, sleep with a silk or satin pillowcase, since these materials will reduce friction between your hair and pillow, thereby preventing frizzy ends. Also start with dry hair which has less moisture thus, preventing a moisture overload. If your scalp is itchy, try adding an essential oil to the mix like tea tree or peppermint.</p>
<p>Twist it up and clip. Apply a plastic cap, apply a turbie twist (or hair wrap to secure in place) and go to bed. A lot of hair grease actually contains ingredients that are bad for your hair. <em>Sleep press on natural unrelaxed hair. Weightless. Long</em>, When making this bun, do not use any bobby pins to keep hair.</p>
