How to prevent hair damage while sleeping the simple way From invisible-lioness.com
To keep your hair straight while you sleep, sleep with a silk or satin pillowcase, since these materials will reduce friction between your hair and pillow, thereby preventing frizzy ends. I let my hair air dry about halfway and then diffuse dry the rest in the winter (in the summer i let it completely air dry or spend 5 minutes at most with a diffuser). You can wear a satin or silk bonnet, wrap your head with a satin or silk scarf, or use a satin or silk pillowcase. The satin fabric does not rub your hair as much as cotton fabric.
