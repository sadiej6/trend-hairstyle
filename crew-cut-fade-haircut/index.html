22 Crew Cut Haircuts In Short, Medium, Long Lengths &#43; Cool From menshairstyletrends.com
While longer hair is allowed up top for a crew cut, buzz cuts typically reduce all hair to a uniform length that’s quite short. Crew cuts often get confused with a military style buzz cut or half buzz cut since the sides and back of the head are typically buzzed to a uniform length then faded to longer hair on top. So, what’s the difference between a crew cut and a fade? Fades make crew cut very cool but this style takes it on another level.
