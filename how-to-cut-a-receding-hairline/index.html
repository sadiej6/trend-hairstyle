Pin su Haircuts With Receding hairline From pinterest.com
The best haircuts for receding hairlines tend to be short on the sides and back, and range from short to medium length to long on top. When hair is cut very short and evenly as it often is with buzz cuts, thinning hair appears less obvious overall. The choice of haircut can make a big difference to the aesthetics of a receding hairline. This short length works well in making the hair appear thicker and the front can be styled to mask the offending areas around the hairline.
