The crew cut is a classic short men’s haircut in which the hair is trimmed slightly longer than a buzz cut. A crew cut is a type of haircut in which the upright hair on the top of the head is cut relatively short, graduated in length from the longest hair that forms a short pomp at the front hairline to the shortest at the back of the crown so that in side profile, the outline of the top hair approaches the horizontal. A crew cut is more of a styled cut, the sides are shaved off, and the back both quite short, and the top longer, and blended in with the sides. Many barbers tend to bald the hair around the sides and back of the head beforehand and taper the cut so that it gradually gets thicker as it extends to the top of the head giving it the “faded” look.
