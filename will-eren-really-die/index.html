Eren has survived getting beheaded before, so why.</p>

<p>Does Eren Survive In Attack On Titan In the end, this anime can’t be predicted. Eren was not a person who would change his plans in a hurry. Eren eventually dies at the hands of mikasa ackerman, who decapitates him in order to stop his genocidal actions. No matter eren desires to do, it must be finished in a brief period of time. 4.2/5 ( 70 votes.</p>

Will Eren Yeager Die in Attack on Titan.</h3><p>Despite having turned into a villain as of late, eren is still the lead character of attack on titan, and one of its most recognizable. This is because the main protagonist eren yeager got decapitated in chapter 138, but did he really die for good? Since eren put the rumbling in motion, it was decided that eren would die. Getting defeated by levi was actually part of his plan. Eren eventually dies at the hands of mikasa ackerman, who decapitates him in order to stop his genocidal actions. Armin begins ridiculing eren, joking that mikasa will forget about him quickly, and eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want mikasa to love anyone but him.</p>
<p>Attack on titan episode 78 saw eren and zeke finally reach each other after trying to reunite since the beginning of season 4 part 2. Instead, he escapes the titan’s stomach by turning into a titan himself. Eren�s death seems the most likely. <em>Will Eren Yeager Die in Attack on Titan</em>, Unsure if you knew this.</p>
