You can make fuzzy styles by backcombing hair and then roll it with by hand. The first way is by using a crochet hook to make locs using human hair extensions. This technique is called palm rolling and is the most effective way to create a dread by yourself. You can remove the rubber bands from your dreadlocks about a month or so after making your dreadlocks, once your hair has really got a chance to lock and bind together.
