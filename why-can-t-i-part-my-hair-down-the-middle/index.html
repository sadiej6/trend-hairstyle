Comb back your wet hair with your fingers, and then push forward with your palm at the crown of your head, warren instructs. This can be achieved in most cases by using styling product and drying the hair with a blow dryer using a lifting action to create more volume in the hair at the back of the head. What’s also weird is that the hairs only seem to fall out from the middle of my hairline (at the widow’s peak), and not at the temples, which is where baldness or thinning should be occurring (at least in my family history). I have never in my life rocked a middle part.
