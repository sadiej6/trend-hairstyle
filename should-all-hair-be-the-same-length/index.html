Considering cutting my hair to this length! This is my From reddit.com
My hair would look so much longer if it was the same length in the back as the front. I�m going to wait until my hair grows at least 3 more inches then i�ll consider a trim or cut to make it more even. For a layered look all the lengths can be different but should remain in ascending order, e.g 16, 18 and 20. Great quality hair is made from hair strands that are all approximately the same length so the thickness of the hair should be the same all the way down its length.
