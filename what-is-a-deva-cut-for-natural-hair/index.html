The Mane Objective Hair Update My Second Deva Cut &#43; Color From maneobjective.com
The deva cut focuses on either sculpting each curl by cutting it at an angle so the curl pattern is not disrupted or using a technique of cutting curl by curl. This unique haircut is always customized for each curl pattern, and it requires strict and extensive training by every stylist. This curl exclusive cut requires special training to learn the technique. Cutting wet curly hair does not allow the stylist to see where your curls will naturally fall, so having your curls cut at this state will not allow you or the stylist to see the true desired shape.
