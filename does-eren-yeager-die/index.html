Attack On Titan Eren Dies From aot-best.blogspot.com
That being stated, there may be something that also worries us. So in episode 5 eren died by sacraficing himself, but it was actually a fake out, and he ended up transforming. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens.
